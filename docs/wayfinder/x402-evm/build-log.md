# x402/EVM PR 1 — build log

Running status log for the PR 1 implementation stack. One section per
sub-component, appended in build order. Specs: [PR1-SPEC.md](PR1-SPEC.md),
map: [MAP.md](MAP.md).

## Sub-component 1 — spec refresh (`x402-1-spec-refresh`) — 2026-08-11

**Branch:** `x402-1-spec-refresh`, cut from `masumi-payment-v2-migration`
(`a7fe04283`). Two commits so far: the wayfinder docs import (including the
ADR 0001 Proposed→Accepted ratification edit, which was still uncommitted in
the working tree) and the spec refresh.

### What changed in the specs: nothing

`pnpm --filter @sokosumi/masumi fetch:specs` fetched both deployed specs
(payment.masumi.network / registry.masumi.network) and wrote them over the
pins; both came back **byte-identical** to the 2026-08-07 snapshots
(payment `1.0.0`, registry `0.1.2`). `pnpm generate:api` reran both hey-api
clients and produced zero diff. The "pinned specs lag upstream `main`" caveat
in PR1-SPEC §7 is resolved in the good direction: the pins already ARE the
deployed x402 surface. Only `spec/SPEC_SOURCES.md` changed (provenance note).

- **`/x402/*` paths present in the pin (20):** `/x402/pay`, `/x402/verify`,
  `/x402/settle`, `/x402/networks`, `/x402/networks/available`,
  `/x402/budgets`, `/x402/wallets` (+ detail/delete/update/balance/count),
  `/x402/payments` (+ reconcile/count), `/x402/settlements` (+ count),
  `/x402/low-balance`, `/x402/analytics`, `/payment/x402`.
- **Registry entry surface:** V2 landmarks all present — `X402` entry type,
  `x402ResourcesUrl`, `SupportedPaymentSources`, per-source pricing
  (`Fixed`/`Dynamic`/`Free` union with `asset`/`amount`/`decimals`).
- **`POST /x402/pay` contract (pin):** request
  `{ evmWalletId, paymentRequired, preferredNetwork?, preferredAsset?, paymentIdentifier? }`;
  200 data `{ attemptId, payer, caip2Network ("eip155:N"), asset (0x…),
  amount (base units), payTo, xPaymentHeader, … }` — matches the PR1-SPEC §3
  request/response shapes.

### Verification

- `pnpm --filter @sokosumi/masumi test` — 11 files, 207 tests passed.
- `pnpm --filter @sokosumi/masumi test:specs` — 4 passed (fetch-specs guards).
- `pnpm typecheck` — all 9 workspaces clean.
- `pnpm check` — 2973 files, no fixes.
- No hand-written client code needed changes (nothing regenerated differently).

### Surprises

- None material. hey-api emits pre-existing "Transformers warning: schema …
  too complex" notices for the pricing unions during `generate:api`; harmless,
  present before this refresh.
- The refresh commit carries only the `SPEC_SOURCES.md` provenance note, since
  specs and generated clients were already current.

### What sub-component 2 (TaskX402Payment schema + migration) needs to know

- **No client-surface drift to absorb.** Generated types under
  `packages/masumi/src/clients/openapi/generated/` are stable; build the
  Prisma model straight from PR1-SPEC §4 as written.
- Field shapes the node will hand back for the record: `attemptId: string`,
  `payer` (EIP-3009 `from` → `payerAddress`), `caip2Network` matching
  `^eip155:\d+$`, `asset` as a 0x ERC-20 address, `amount` as a base-unit
  digit string, `payTo` 0x address — the `String` columns in the spec's model
  are right; no numeric columns.
- `paymentIdentifier` is a top-level optional request field on `/x402/pay`
  (the task-identity correlation echo, PR1-SPEC §3) — nothing extra to store
  beyond the spec's columns.
- The dedupe unique is `@@unique([taskId, idempotencyKey])` and the node has
  **no idempotency of its own** (ticket 011) — the migration must ship that
  unique in the same change as the table, never as a follow-up.
- Reminder from the spec: `TaskX402PaymentStatus` enum
  `PENDING|VERIFIED|FAILED|REFUNDED`, `@@index([agentId, status])` for the
  per-endpoint refund aggregation, plus the FK-free append-only
  `TaskX402PaymentAction` sibling.
