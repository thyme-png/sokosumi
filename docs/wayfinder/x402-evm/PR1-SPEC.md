## 1. Scope

API-only. A coworker assigned to a task can (a) **list** the x402/Bazaar
agents Soko can pay right now, and (b) **pay** a 402 one of them returned,
charged to the task's org in credits, receiving a signed `X-PAYMENT` header
to replay with. No end-user catalog change, no hire flow, no job row — the
coworker calls the agent **outside** Soko.

Out of scope: masumi-job x402 (PR 2), direct CDP-Bazaar crawling (agents must
be Masumi-registered), end-user hireability.

The full loop (Patrick's four steps):

```
coworker → GET  /v1/agents/x402                     (list; pick base URL)
coworker → call the Bazaar agent directly           (outside Soko) → 402
coworker → POST /v1/tasks/{taskId}/x402-payments     (forward the 402)
   soko  → charge task org in credits, POST node /x402/pay, persist record
coworker ← { xPaymentHeader, attemptId, paymentId }
coworker → replay the agent call with X-PAYMENT      (outside Soko) → result
```

## 2. Listing endpoint — `GET /v1/agents/x402`

Ticket 005. Dedicated coworker-gated route; the end-user catalog's
`type: STANDARD` exclusion in `buildAvailableAgentWhereClause` is untouched.

- **Authz:** coworker context only (same gate as the pay endpoint).
- **Fail closed** — an agent appears only if payable *now*:
  1. curated/whitelisted (production; preprod lists all — see §6),
  2. every advertised asset resolves to a `CreditCost` row,
  3. its network is in the per-environment EVM allowlist (preprod = testnet
     CAIP-2 ids only),
  4. x402 buy-side readiness OK (§6).
- **Response fields per agent:** id, name, description, image (all resolved
  through the existing `AgentMetadataOverride`-aware helpers — X402 agents
  carry the standard override fields so a later read-only UI needs no
  rework), `x402ResourcesUrl`, and the payment sources (CAIP-2 network,
  asset, decimals, `payTo`, advertised price in both native units and
  converted credits).
- Listed ⇒ payable gives per-endpoint refund aggregation (§5) a stable
  population to count against.

## 3. Pay endpoint — `POST /v1/tasks/{taskId}/x402-payments`

Ticket 003. A thin, **verified** proxy of the node's `POST /x402/pay`.

### Request

Modeled on the node's own request so translation is minimal:

```jsonc
{
  "idempotencyKey": "coworker-supplied, unique per intent",   // required
  "agentId": "the listed agent this 402 came from",           // required
  "paymentRequired": { /* the raw 402 body, verbatim, either dialect */ }
}
```

- `evmWalletId` is **never** caller-supplied — Soko owns the purchasing
  wallet per environment/network.
- Task identity (taskId, the created event id) is stamped into the node
  call's `paymentIdentifier` — **only when the agent's 402 advertises the
  payment-identifier extension** (the node 400s otherwise; ticket 011 Q2).
  It is a fail-loud correlation echo, never a dedup key.
- **Dialect normalization (ticket 011 Q6):** the node accepts v2-shaped
  `accepts` entries only. Soko accepts either wild dialect from the coworker
  (v1 JSON body or v2 base64 header transport) and normalizes to v2
  (`maxAmountRequired`→`amount`, network names→CAIP-2) before forwarding.
- `agentId` is required so the verification below is an exact lookup, not a
  `payTo` reverse search.

### What Soko does, in order

1. **Authz** — `requireTaskCollaboration` + `isCoworkerAgentContext`,
   identical to the `masumiPayment` task-event gate. Org and owner come from
   the task row; sub-tasks are tasks (`parentTaskId`), so they are covered by
   the same gate. Ticket 003.
2. **Idempotency** — look up the payment record by `(taskId?, idempotencyKey)`
   unique. If it exists, return its stored result verbatim (idempotent
   replay); do not charge or sign again.
3. **Verify against the listed agent** — the 402's `payTo` + network + asset
   must match `agentId`'s registered payment source, the network must be in
   the per-env allowlist, and the demanded amount must pass a sanity check
   against the agent's registry pricing. Any failure → `4xx` **before any
   charge**. Ticket 003.
4. **Price** — convert the demanded amount to credits via the CAIP-19
   `CreditCost` key (§ ticket 004), **ceil to at least
   `MIN_CHARGEABLE_CREDITS`** (charge floor). Reject pre-charge if the asset
   has no `CreditCost` row (fail closed).
5. **Bound** — the charge draws from the task's `maxCredits` pool, the same
   gate as every other task charge. Insufficient → the existing
   out-of-credits path, no partial state.
6. **Charge, then sign** — debit credits and create the payment record
   (`PENDING`) in one transaction; then call node `POST /x402/pay`.
7. **Resolve the sign result:**
   - **200** → record `Verified` with `attemptId` + signed tuple; return the
     `xPaymentHeader`.
   - **node refuses / errors (budget, wallet, chain)** → the signing never
     put funds at risk, so this is **provably unpaid**: refund the credits
     synchronously, mark the record `Failed`, return an actionable error.
     Ticket 006.
   - **crash / timeout between charge and a confirmed sign result** →
     **refund-safe** (upgraded by ticket 011): the node signs locally and
     never sends the buyer's request, so a header Soko never received (or
     never delivered) can never be settled by anyone. The reconciler
     auto-refunds stale `PENDING` records without consulting the node; the
     only leak is node-side budget, never user funds. A coworker retry with
     the same idempotency key on a `PENDING` record re-runs the sign.

### Response

Pass-through of the node's 200 plus Soko's record id:

```jsonc
{
  "paymentId": "soko payment-record id (support / admin refund / status)",
  "attemptId": "node attempt id",
  "xPaymentHeader": "base64 value to replay with",
  "caip2Network": "...", "asset": "...", "amount": "...", "payTo": "..."
}
```

## 4. Data model — `TaskX402Payment`

Sibling of `TaskPaymentClaim`, not a reuse — the escrow claim's state machine
(processing lease, retry ladder, blockchainIdentifier) is meaningless here;
this record is terminal at sign time.

```prisma
model TaskX402Payment {
  id             String   @id @default(uuid(7))
  createdAt      DateTime @default(now())
  updatedAt      DateTime @updatedAt

  idempotencyKey String                 // coworker-supplied
  status         TaskX402PaymentStatus @default(PENDING) // PENDING|VERIFIED|FAILED|REFUNDED

  // What was requested / signed
  caip2Network   String
  asset          String
  amount         String                 // base units, chain-native
  payTo          String
  attemptId      String?                // node attempt id, present once signed
  failureReason  String?
  // Phased settlement observation (ticket 011 Q3): stored now, consumed by a
  // later reconciler that checks EIP-3009 authorizationState after expiry —
  // consumed → settled-observed; unused → EXPIRED_UNUSED → post-hoc
  // auto-refund (provably unpaid). Terminal-at-VERIFIED until that ships.
  payerAddress   String?                // EIP-3009 `from`
  payloadNonce   String?
  paymentPayloadHash String?
  validBefore    DateTime?              // authorization expiry

  // Links: task identity, the charged agent (per-endpoint aggregation),
  // the credit debit, and its compensating refund.
  taskId         String
  agentId        String                 // FK → Agent, the aggregation key
  taskEventId    String?  @unique
  transactionId       String  @unique   // the credit charge
  refundTransactionId String? @unique   // the compensating refund, if any

  @@unique([taskId, idempotencyKey])     // the dedupe unique (ticket 003)
  @@index([agentId, status])             // per-endpoint refund aggregation (§5)
  @@map("task_x402_payment")
}
```

An append-only `TaskX402PaymentAction` mirrors `TaskPaymentClaimAction` for
admin refund/resolve attribution (FK-free, same reasoning).

## 5. Admin & observability

Ticket 006. Two levers, both hanging off the payment record:

- **Admin refund action** on a `TaskX402Payment` — goodwill / support-driven,
  writes a `TaskX402PaymentAction` and a compensating refund transaction.
  Mirrors the admin task-payment-claims surface.
- **Per-endpoint aggregation** — refund count, failure count, and any
  quality/rating signal grouped by `agentId`, surfaced in the admin
  dashboard so a bleeding endpoint can be **disabled / removed from the
  whitelist**. The `@@index([agentId, status])` backs this.

## 6. Environment & operator prerequisites

Cardano-parallel Preprod/Mainnet split (ticket 003):

- **Preprod:** every agent is listed (curation is not the gate); the guard is
  the network allowlist — **EVM testnet CAIP-2 ids only**.
- **Production:** curation/whitelist + mainnet networks.
- **Buy-side readiness (ticket 011 Q5):** composed Soko-side from
  `/x402/networks/available` + `/x402/budgets` (both per-chain today), reusing
  the cached last-known-value pattern from Cardano V2 readiness. The
  env-global `/rail-readiness` x402 checks remain the coarse health signal.
- **Node setup per chain:** X402Network enabled, a funded purchasing EVM
  wallet bound to it, the Soko API key's `ChainIdLimit` covering the target
  `eip155:*` ids. Funding stays a manual verification.

## 7. External dependencies — RESOLVED (ticket 011, from upstream source)

All confirmed against masumi-payment-service `main`; see
[NODE-QUESTIONS.md](NODE-QUESTIONS.md) `## Answers`:

- **Error contract:** 400 = pre-sign rejection, 402 = budget/balance refusal,
  500 = config/signing failure; **any non-200 ⇒ no header issued ⇒
  unsettleable ⇒ synchronous refund always safe.**
- **Idempotency: none by design** — Soko's key is the sole dedupe; a
  double-call costs node budget only, never user funds.
- **By-`attemptId` lookup:** not needed for correctness; paginate-and-match
  covers audit. Low-priority node nicety.
- **Dialect:** v2-shaped only; Soko normalizes (§3).
- The pinned specs lag upstream `main`; refresh via `fetch-specs` is a
  pre-implementation step — the deployed nodes are already current.

## 8. Test strategy

- **Unit:** amount→credits conversion incl. charge-floor and decimals per
  asset; the verify-against-listed-agent matcher (payTo/network/asset,
  per-env allowlist); idempotent-replay returns the stored result without a
  second charge.
- **Route:** authz parity with `masumiPayment` (non-coworker rejected;
  unassigned task rejected); fail-closed listing (unpriced asset, wrong
  network, unready rail each drop the agent); charge-then-refund on a stubbed
  node refusal; PENDING-on-timeout leaves no auto-refund.
- **Mutation-tested** on the money paths, per repo discipline: the charge
  floor, the idempotency unique, the provably-unpaid refund branch.
- Node interaction stubbed at the payment-client boundary (the pinned spec is
  the contract); one integration smoke against a testnet agent on preprod.

## 9. Open question for review

- Endpoint path: `/v1/tasks/{taskId}/x402-payments` (task-nested, matches the
  charge-scope decision) vs a top-level `/v1/x402-payments` with taskId in
  the body. The spec assumes task-nested — confirm.
