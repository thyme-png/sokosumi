# PR 2 spec — masumi-job x402 rail

> **Status:** draft for review (wayfinder ticket 009). Substrate:
> [ADR 0001](../../adr/0001-x402-evm-payment-rail.md) (Accepted) — this spec
> does not restate it; it binds the ADR's decisions to concrete schema, flow,
> and rollout. All former node unknowns are resolved
> ([NODE-QUESTIONS.md](NODE-QUESTIONS.md) `## Answers`).

## 1. Scope

End-user-hireable x402 agents: a paid job on an x402 direct-settlement agent
runs call → 402 → node-pay → replay inside Soko's job pipeline, and the HTTP
response is the result. Escrow paths untouched. Shares with PR 1: CAIP-19
credit keys, dialect normalizer, verify-against-source, the `/x402/pay`
client, refund policy. Ships **after** PR 1; reuses its helpers.

## 2. Schema

- `Job.paymentRail` enum `CARDANO_ESCROW` (default, backfilled) `| X402` —
  pinned at job creation from the agent's payment source (ADR decision 2/
  snapshot-on-job pattern). Migration: add enum + column with default;
  no data rewrite needed beyond the default.
- `JobX402Payment` — sibling of `JobPurchase` AND of PR 1's
  `TaskX402Payment` (two tables by decision, shared columns by convention):
  `jobId @unique`, `attemptId`, `caip2Network`, `asset`, `amount` (BigInt),
  `decimals`, `payTo`, `paymentIdentifier?`, `status`
  (`PENDING | VERIFIED | FAILED | REFUNDED` — terminal at `VERIFIED`,
  confirmed), `failureReason?`, phased-settlement fields (`payerAddress`,
  `payloadNonce`, `paymentPayloadHash`, `validBefore`), `transactionId
  @unique`, `refundTransactionId? @unique`, `@@index([status, validBefore])`
  for the future expiry reconciler.

## 3. Job flow

1. **Create** — availability already gates on rail readiness + priced assets
   (fail closed, as Cardano). Credits debited at hire exactly like escrow
   jobs; price from the agent's x402 source via CAIP-19 keys, charge floor
   applies. `paymentRail = X402` pinned; `JobX402Payment` row `PENDING` in
   the same transaction.
2. **Call** the agent resource; expect 402. Normalize dialect (PR 1 helper),
   verify payTo/network/asset against the job's snapshotted source, amount
   ≤ the job's charged price (drift → fail the job, refund — provably
   unpaid, nothing signed).
3. **Pay** — node `POST /x402/pay` (Soko wallet, `paymentIdentifier` only if
   advertised). Non-200 → **synchronous refund**, job `PAYMENT_FAILED`
   (provably unpaid, confirmed). 200 → record `VERIFIED` + tuple + phased
   fields.
4. **Replay** the original request with `xPaymentHeader`. 2xx → response is
   the result; persist, job completes. Non-2xx/timeout after a signed header
   → job fails, **debit stands** (not provably unpaid — the agent holds a
   settleable header), admin refund lever only. Record keeps the evidence
   for the future `EXPIRED_UNUSED` reconciler, which may post-hoc
   auto-refund if the authorization expires unused.
5. **No polling, no purchase sync** — the x402 job never enters the escrow
   sync selectors (`paymentRail` filter added to
   `buildJobsNeedingPurchaseSyncWhere` / `buildJobsPendingLocalRefundWhere`
   so selectors stay provably disjoint per rail).

## 4. Availability flip

`buildAvailableAgentWhereClause` admits x402-source agents when: whitelisted,
assets priced, per-env network allowlist, composed buy-side readiness OK
(`/x402/networks/available` + `/x402/budgets`, cached last-known-value,
fail-closed cold). Same gates as PR 1's listing — one shared predicate.

## 5. Refund policy binding (ticket 006)

Auto-refund **only** provably-unpaid: nothing signed (steps 2–3 failures) or
node refusal. After a header exists: debit stands; admin lever
(`JobX402PaymentAction` audit, mirroring PR 1); per-agent failure/refund
aggregation feeds the same whitelist-disable dashboard. Future: expired-unused
post-hoc auto-refund via the phased reconciler.

## 6. Rollout

- Flag-free, like V2: the rail activates per-agent via availability (readiness
  + pricing + whitelist). No `paymentRail` rows exist until an x402 agent is
  hired; binary rollback is clean until the first x402 hire (new enum value
  on `Job.paymentRail` is the fence — document in PR body).
- Operator prereqs: X402Network enabled + funded purchasing wallet per chain,
  `ChainIdLimit` covering targets, budgets set. Preprod = testnets only.
- Pre-implementation step: refresh pinned specs (`fetch-specs`) — deployed
  nodes already run the x402 surface.

## 7. Tests

Unit: rail pinning at creation; drift rejection (step 2); refund branches
(provably-unpaid vs debit-stands) mutation-tested; selector disjointness per
rail. Route: hire → 402 → pay → replay happy path against a stubbed client;
non-200 pay → synchronous refund; failed replay → no refund + record
evidence. One preprod e2e against a live testnet x402 agent.
